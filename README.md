# How to run this programs?
For run these programs, you must have java installed in your machine and download a directory of program class. Run inside directory of program in terminal:

`
java Program  #Ignore .class extencion
`

This way, you download the already compiled program and only need to run the .class file (with the main function), specified in each program's section.

To compile and run programs from source code, download the program's source directory and compile the .java file corresponding to the main file inside directory of program as follows:

`
javac Program.java
`

For compile, do you need the tool javac from JDK (Java Development Kit).
